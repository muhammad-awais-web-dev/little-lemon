            <p>Little Lemon began as a small idea between relatives who loved to cook. Inspired by memories of slow-simmered sauces, sun-ripened lemons, and family gatherings around a crowded table, we set out to bring those flavours to our neighbourhood, but with a contemporary twist. We respect the classics, but we arenâ€™t afraid to experiment: think slow-roasted eggplant served with a zesty citrus dressing, or a time-honoured lamb recipe lightened with seasonal herbs.</p>
