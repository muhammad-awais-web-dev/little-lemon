## üöÄ Project Progress

### Step 1: Setup of the Project

**Overview**  
Before building the Little Lemon React app, the project needed to be set up properly. Instead of coding everything from scratch, a boilerplate React project was initialized and cleaned up for a smooth start.  

This step also included installing helpful VS Code extensions that improve development efficiency and readability.  

**Scenario**  
The goal was to prepare the foundation for the **Reserve a Table** feature of the Little Lemon website by creating and organizing the React project structure.  

---

**Instructions Followed**

1. **VS Code Extensions Installed**
   - **ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native** ‚Üí Provides React and JavaScript snippets.  
   - **Auto Rename Tag** ‚Üí Automatically renames paired HTML/JSX tags.  
   - **Trailing Spaces** ‚Üí Highlights and removes accidental whitespace.  

2. **Created the React Project**  
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app little-lemon
   cd little-lemon
---

### Step 2: First Commit

**Overview**  
After setting up and cleaning the React project in Step 1, the next step was to make the **first commit** and push the changes to the GitHub repository. This ensures the project setup is properly tracked with version control, making it easier to manage progress and collaborate if needed.  

---

**Scenario**  
As development of the Little Lemon React app progresses, every change needs to be committed and pushed to GitHub. This helps in:  
- Keeping a history of project updates  
- Allowing others (or future me) to view and collaborate on the code  
- Providing a backup of the work in case of local issues  

---

**Instructions Followed**

1. **Saved All Updates**  
   - Ensured all modified files were saved in VS Code.  

2. **Staged and Committed Changes**  
   ```bash
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Simplify boilerplate app ‚Äì removed logo and cleaned App.js"

3. **Pushed Changes to GitHub**  
   ```bash
   git push

4. **Verified on GitHub**
 - Navigated to the Little Lemon repo
 - Confirmed that the new commit appeared in the history with the proper message.

### Step 3: Created Wireframe

**Overview**  
Before jumping into coding the UI, the homepage and reserve-a-table flow of the Little Lemon website were **wireframed in Figma**. Wireframes act like digital blueprints, focusing on structure and user experience before adding colors, images, or branding.  

This step ensured that the navigation, layout, and core features of the app were mapped out clearly.  

---

**Scenario**  
The Little Lemon website was missing a clear **Reserve a Table** feature. To solve this, the homepage wireframe was created with a dedicated button and proper navigation to highlight this option. Other sections were also planned to ensure a professional and user-friendly structure.  

---

**Instructions Followed**

1. **Client‚Äôs Requirements Identified**  
   - About Little Lemon  
   - Highlights and specials  
   - Descriptions and photos of dishes  
   - Navigation bar

3. **Designed Navigation Bar Block**

‚úÖ At this stage, the **homepage wireframe** and layout for key pages are complete in Figma.  
This provides a strong foundation to start designing the actual UI and ensures that the **Reserve a Table** feature is properly integrated into the flow.
