# Little Lemon Restaurant - React App

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is the **Capstone Project** for the **Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate**.  
It focuses on building a fully functional **React.js web application** for a fictional restaurant called **Little Lemon**.  

The purpose of this project is to bring together everything learned throughout the specialization — including **React fundamentals, routing, form handling, testing, accessibility, and responsive design** — into a real-world, client-focused application.

## 🚀 Project Progress

### Step 1: Setup of the Project

**Overview**  
Before building the Little Lemon React app, the project needed to be set up properly. Instead of coding everything from scratch, a boilerplate React project was initialized and cleaned up for a smooth start.  

This step also included installing helpful VS Code extensions that improve development efficiency and readability.  

**Scenario**  
The goal was to prepare the foundation for the **Reserve a Table** feature of the Little Lemon website by creating and organizing the React project structure.  

---

**Instructions Followed**

1. **VS Code Extensions Installed**
   - **ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native** → Provides React and JavaScript snippets.  
   - **Auto Rename Tag** → Automatically renames paired HTML/JSX tags.  
   - **Trailing Spaces** → Highlights and removes accidental whitespace.  

2. **Created the React Project**  
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app little-lemon
   cd little-lemon

### Step 2: First Commit

**Overview**  
After setting up and cleaning the React project in Step 1, the next step was to make the **first commit** and push the changes to the GitHub repository. This ensures the project setup is properly tracked with version control, making it easier to manage progress and collaborate if needed.  

---

**Scenario**  
As development of the Little Lemon React app progresses, every change needs to be committed and pushed to GitHub. This helps in:  
- Keeping a history of project updates  
- Allowing others (or future me) to view and collaborate on the code  
- Providing a backup of the work in case of local issues  

---

**Instructions Followed**

1. **Saved All Updates**  
   - Ensured all modified files were saved in VS Code.  

2. **Staged and Committed Changes**  
   ```bash
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Simplify boilerplate app – removed logo and cleaned App.js"

3. **Pushed Changes to GitHub**  
   ```bash
   git push

4. **Verified on GitHub**
 - Navigated to the Little Lemon repo
 - Confirmed that the new commit appeared in the history with the proper message.
