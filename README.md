## 🚀 Project Progress

### Step 1: Setup of the Project

**Overview**  
Before building the Little Lemon React app, the project needed to be set up properly. Instead of coding everything from scratch, a boilerplate React project was initialized and cleaned up for a smooth start.  

This step also included installing helpful VS Code extensions that improve development efficiency and readability.  

**Scenario**  
The goal was to prepare the foundation for the **Reserve a Table** feature of the Little Lemon website by creating and organizing the React project structure.

**Instructions Followed**

1. **VS Code Extensions Installed**
   - **ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native** → Provides React and JavaScript snippets.  
   - **Auto Rename Tag** → Automatically renames paired HTML/JSX tags.  
   - **Trailing Spaces** → Highlights and removes accidental whitespace.  

2. **Created the React Project**  
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app little-lemon
   cd little-lemon
